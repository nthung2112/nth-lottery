# User Guide

## Steps

1. **Initial Setup**:  
  Upon first access, no data will be displayed. You can choose to use the default data to view the overall display effect. It is recommended to import your own data for operation. Follow these steps:

      a. **Personnel Configuration** - Navigate to the "Personnel List" section and click **Download Template** to download the data template. Fill in the data while ensuring that the headers remain unchanged.

      b. After editing, click **Upload File** on the same page to upload the modified Excel file.

2. **Prize Configuration**:  
  Edit your prize information in the prize configuration section. Keep the names short for better display.

  - **"All Participants"**: Indicates whether the prize is drawn from the entire pool of participants (including those who have already won).
  - **Number of Winners**: Specifies how many people will win this prize.
  - **Number of Winners So Far**: Non-editable; tracks the number of winners already selected.
  - **"Selected" Option**: When selected, the prize is marked as used. Deselecting it will reset the prize, but not the winners already selected.
  - **Image**: Used to display the prize on the homepage (images can be uploaded in the image list).
  - **Left-Side Icons**: Adjust the order of prizes.

  After completing the above two steps, the system is ready for use.

## Feature Descriptions

1. **Add Temporary Draws**:  
  On the draw page, click the "+" button in the prize list to temporarily add a draw. Note: Only one temporary draw can be added at a time. Once added, the current prize will be set as the temporary one. After a winner is selected, the system will return to the normal prize list.

2. **Music and Image Library**:  
  You can upload files for use. Uploaded images can be selected for prize display in the prize configuration section. Uploaded music will be added to the playback list.

3. **Music Playback**:
  - **Left-Click**: Play/Pause.
  - **Right-Click**: Play the next track.

4. **Interface Configuration**:  
  In the "Pattern Settings" section, you can customize the highlighted patterns on the homepage by clicking with your mouse.

5. **Hide Prize List on Homepage**:  
  To hide the prize list from being displayed on the homepage, enable the "Always Show Prize List" option in the interface configuration.

6. **Button Value Update**:  
  When clicking a button on the homepage, the button value will not update immediately. It will update to the target value after the animation ends—this is normal behavior.
